1. Install Xcode from AppStore
2. Install xcode command line tools. On terminal run  `xcode-select --install`

## Future ideas
This might be made better by adding a makefile and some additional files to setup all the required things including setting the dock always to the left and configuring what applications are locker to dock etc.
